# cal_fast_fourier_transform
Calculate fast fourier transform given an input wave by using scipy Fast Fourier Transform function fft. This is written in Python 3.

# Contents

Generate an input wave.

Plot the wave in the space dimension.

Use fast fourier transform function fft to calculate results.

Plot the results in the frequency dimension.

# Installation

It needs to have scipy.fftpack library, go to the link https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.fftpack.fft.html#scipy.fftpack.fft

# License

It doesn't need a license to use this program.
